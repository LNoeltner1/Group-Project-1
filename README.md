- K!DSTR
  Overview:
  It's clear technology is here to stay and our lives are very much so digitally driven. Our world is full of powerful technology tools that literally anyone can get their hands on, that includes kids. There are all kinds of content on the internet ranging from appropriate kid friendly to not so appropriate content for children. All things considered, parents naturally worry about their kids' access to inappropriate content online. In our tech driven world, it's imperative we keep our kids safe. That's why we created K!DSTR!

User Story:
"It isn't always easy monitoring what my kids watch on the internet when I'm not around.I want to keep my kids entertained with safe content while I'm occupied elsewhere. I love this app because it allows my kids to surf the web with all explicit content filtered out."
